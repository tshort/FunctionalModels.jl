This document provides a general introduction to Sims.

## Unknowns

Models consist of equations and unknown variables. The number of
equations should match the number of unknowns. In Sims, the type
Unknown is used to define unknown variables. Without the constructor
parts, the definition of Unknown is:

```julia
type Unknown{T<:UnknownCategory} <: UnknownVariable
    sym::Symbol
    value         # holds initial values (and type info)
    label::AbstractString 
end
```

`Unknown`s can be grouped into categories. That's what the `T` is for in
the definition above. One can define different types of `Unknowns`
(electrical vs. mechanical for example). The default is
`DefaultUnknown`. Unknowns of different types can also be used to define
models of the same name that act differently depending on what type of
node they are connected to.

Unknowns also contain a value. This is used for setting initial
values, and these values are updated if there is a structural change
in the model. Unknowns can be different types. Eventually, all
Unknowns are converted to Float64's in an array for simulation.
Currently, Sim supports Unknowns of type `Float64`, `Complex128`, and
arrays of either of these. Adding support for other structures is not
hard as long as they can be converted to `Float64`'s.

The label string is used for labeling simulation outputs. Unlabeled
Unknowns are not included in results.

Here are several ways to define Unknowns:

```julia
x = Unknown()          # An initial value of 0.0 with no labeling.
y = Unknown(1.0, "y")  # An initial value of 1.0 and a label of "y" on outputs.
z = Unknown([1.0, 0.0], "vector")  # An Unknown with array values.
V = Unknown{Voltage}(10.0, "Output voltage")  # An Unknown of type Voltage
```

Here are ways to create new Unknown types:

```julia
# Untyped Unknowns:
Angle = AngularVelocity = AngularAcceleration = Torque = RotationalNode = Unknown

# Typed Unknowns:
type UVoltage <: UnknownCategory
end
type UCurrent <: UnknownCategory
end
typealias ElectricalNode Unknown{UVoltage}
typealias Voltage Unknown{UVoltage}
typealias Current Unknown{UCurrent}
```
In model equations, derivatives are specified with der:

```julia
   der(y)
```

Derivatives of `Unknowns` are an object of type `DerUnknown`. `DerUnknown`
objects contain an initial value, and a pointer to the `Unknown` object
it references. Initial values can be entered as the second
parameter to the `der` function:

```julia
   der(y, 3.0) - (x+1)   #  The derivative of y starts with the value 3.0
```

## Models

Here is a model of the Van Der Pol oscillator:

```julia
function Vanderpol()
    y = Unknown(1.0, "y")   
    x = Unknown("x")       
    # The following gives the return value which is a list of equations.
    # Expressions with Unknowns are kept as expressions. Regular
    # variables are evaluated immediately (like normal).
    Equation[
        der(x, -1.0) - ((1 - y^2) * x - y)   # == 0 is assumed
        der(y) - x
    ]
end
```

A device model is a function that returns a list of equations or other
devices that also return lists of equations. The equations each are
assumed equal to zero. In Julia, this is the best we can do, because
there isn't an equality operator (`==` doesn't fit the bill, either).

Models should normally be locally balanced, meaning the number of
unknowns matches the number of equations. It's pretty easy to match
unknowns and equations as shown below:

```julia
function Capacitor(n1, n2, C::Real) 
    i = Current()              # Unknown #1
    v = Voltage()              # Unknown #2
    Equation[
        Branch(n1, n2, v, i)      # Equation #1 - this returns n1 - n2 - v
        C * der(v) - i            # Equation #2
    ]
end
```

In the model above, the nodes `n1` and `n2` are also `Unknowns`, but they
are defined outside of this model.

Here is the top-level circuit definition. In this case, there are no
input parameters. The ground reference `g` is assigned zero volts.

```julia
function Circuit()
    n1 = ElectricalNode("Source voltage")   # The string indicates labeling for plots
    n2 = ElectricalNode("Output voltage")
    n3 = ElectricalNode()
    g = 0.0  # a ground has zero volts; it's not an Unknown.
    Equation[
        VSource(n1, g, 10.0, 60.0)
        Resistor(n1, n2, 10.0)
        Resistor(n2, g, 5.0)
        SeriesProbe(n2, n3, "Capacitor current")
        Capacitor(n3, g, 5.0e-3)
    ]
end
```

All of the equations returned in this list of equations are other
models with different parameters.

In this top-level model, three new Unknowns are introduced (`n1`, `n2`,
and `n2`). Because these are nodes, each Unknown node will also cause an
equation to be generated that sums the flows into the node to be zero.

In this model, the voltages `n1` and `n2` are labeled, so they will
appear in the output. A `SeriesProbe` is used to label the current
through the capacitor.


## Simulating a Model

Steps to building and simulating a model are straightforward.

```julia
v = Vanderpol()       # returns the hierarchical model
v_f = elaborate(v)    # returns the flattened model
v_s = create_sim(v_f) # returns a "Sim" ready for simulation
v_yout = sim(v_s, 10.0) # run the simulation to 10 seconds and return
                        # the result as an array plus column headings
```

Two solvers are available: `dasslsim` and `sunsim` using the
[Sundials](https://github.com/tshort/Sundials.jl). Right now, `sim` is
equivalent to `sunsim`.

Simulations can also be run directly from a hierarchical model:

```julia
v_yout = sim(v, 10.0) 
```

Right now, there are really no options available for simulation
parameters.

## Simulation Output and Plotting

The result of a `sim` run is an object with components `y` and
`colnames`. `y` is a two-dimensional array with time slices along
rows and variables along columns. The first column is simulation
time. The remaining columns are for each unknown in the model
including derivatives. `colnames` contains the names of each of
the columns in `y` after the time column.

Sims uses `Plots.jl` for plotting columns of output. Here are examples:

```@example
using Plots
v = sim(Sims.Examples.Basics.Vanderpol(), 10.0)
plot(v)
z = sim(Sims.Examples.Lib.CauerLowPassAnalog(), 60.0)
plot(z)
plot(z, layout = 1, legend = true)
plot(z, columns = [2,4])
plot(z, columns = 2:4)
plot(z, columns = ["n1", "n2"])
```

## Hybrid Modeling

Sims provides basic support for hybrid modeling. Discrete variables
are variables that are not involved in integration but apply when
"events" occur. Models can define events denoting changes in behavior.

`Event` is the main type used for hybrid modeling. It contains a
condition for root finding and model expressions to process after
positive and negative root crossings are detected.

```julia
type Event <: ModelType
    condition::ModelType   # An expression used for the event detection. 
    pos_response::Model    # An expression indicating what to do when
                           # the condition crosses zero positively.
    neg_response::Model    # An expression indicating what to do when
                           # the condition crosses zero in the
                           # negative direction.
end
```

The function `reinit` is used in `Event` responses to redefine variables.
Here is an example of a voltage source defined with a square wave:

```julia
function VSquare(n1, n2, V::Real, f::Real)  
    i = Current()
    v = Voltage()
    v_mag = Discrete(V)
    Equation[
        Branch(n1, n2, v, i)
        v - v_mag
        Event(sin(2 * pi * f * MTime),
              Equation[reinit(v_mag, V)],    # positive crossing
              Equation[reinit(v_mag, -V)])   # negative crossing
    ]
end
```

The variable `v_mag` is the `Discrete` variable that is changed using
reinit whenever the `sin(2 * pi * f * MTime)` crosses zero. A response
is provided for both positive and negative zero crossings.

Two other constructs that are useful are `BoolEvent` and `ifelse`. 
ifelse is like an if-then-else block, but for `ModelTypes` (you can't
use a regular if-then-else block, at least not without macros).  
`BoolEvent` is a helper for attaching an event to a boolean variable.
Here is an example for an ideal diode:

```julia
function IdealDiode(n1, n2)
    i = Current()
    v = Voltage()
    s = Unknown()  # dummy variable
    openswitch = Discrete(false)  # on/off state of diode
    Equation[
        Branch(n1, n2, v, i)
        BoolEvent(openswitch, -s)  # openswitch becomes true when s goes negative
        v - ifelse(openswitch, s, 0.0) 
        i - ifelse(openswitch, 0.0, s) 
    ]
end
```

`Discrete` variables are based on `Signals` from the
[Reactive.jl](http://julialang.org/Reactive.jl/) package. This
provides
[Reactive Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming)
capabilities where variables have data flow. This is similar to how
spreadsheets dynamically update and how Simulink works. This `lift`
operator defines dependencies based on a function, and `reinit` is
used to update inputs. Here is an example:

```julia
a = Discrete(2.0)
b = Discrete(4.0)
c = lift((x,y) -> x * y, a, b)   # 8.0
reinit(a, 4.0)  # c becomes 16.0
```

`Parameter`s are a special type of `Discrete` variable. These can be used
as input to models. These stay alive through flattening and simulation
creation. They can be updated externally from one simulation to the
next.


## Structurally Varying Systems

`StructuralEvent` defines a type for elements that change the structure
of the model. An event is created, and when the event is triggered,
the model is re-flattened after replacing `default` with
`new_relation` in the model.

```julia
type StructuralEvent <: ModelType
    condition::ModelType   # Expression indicating a zero crossing for event detection.
    default                # The default relation.
    new_relation::Function # Function to call when the new relation is needed.
    activated::Bool        # Used internally to indicate whether the event fired.
end
```

Here is an example for a breaking pendulum. The model starts with the
Pendulum construct. Then, when five seconds is reached, the
StructuralEvent triggers, and the model is recompiled with the
FreeFall construct.

```julia
function BreakingPendulum()
    x = Unknown(cos(pi/4), "x")
    y = Unknown(-cos(pi/4), "y")
    vx = Unknown()
    vy = Unknown()
    Equation[
        StructuralEvent(MTime - 5.0,     # when time hits 5 sec, switch to FreeFall
            Pendulum(x,y,vx,vy),
            () -> FreeFall(x,y,vx,vy))
    ]
end
```

One special thing to note is that `new_relation` must be a function (in
the case above, an anonymous function). If `new_relation` is not a
function, it will evaluate right away. The use of a function delays
evaluation until the model is recompiled.
