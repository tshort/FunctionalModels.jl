Sims.jl
=======

A [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for equation-based modeling
and simulations. For more information, see the documentation:

* **[Documentation for the released version](https://tshort.github.io/Sims.jl/stable)**.
* **[Documentation for the development version](https://tshort.github.io/Sims.jl/latest)**.


Background
----------

This package is for non-causal modeling in Julia. The idea behind
non-causal modeling is that the user develops models based on
components which are described by a set of equations. A tool can then
transform the equations and solve the differential algebraic
equations. Non-causal models tend to match their physical counterparts
in terms of their specification and implementation.

Causal modeling is where all signals have an input and an output, and
the flow of information is clear. Simulink is the highest-profile
example. The problem with causal modeling is that it is difficult to
build up models from components.

The highest profile noncausal modeling tools are in the
[Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/) family. The MathWorks company also has
Simscape that uses Matlab notation. Modelica is an object-oriented,
open language with multiple implementations. It is a large, complex,
powerful language with an extensive standard library of components.

This implementation follows the work of
[David Broman](http://web.ict.kth.se/~dbro/)
([thesis](http://www.bromans.com/david/publ/thesis-2010-david-broman.pdf)
and [code](http://www.bromans.com/software/mkl/mkl-source-1.0.0.zip))
and [George Giorgidze](http://db.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/team/giorgidze)
([Hydra code](https://github.com/giorgidze/Hydra) and
[thesis](http://db.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/files/giorgidze/phd_thesis.pdf))
and [Henrik Nilsson](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/) and their
functional hybrid modeling. Sims is most similar to
[Modelyze](https://github.com/david-broman/modelyze) by David Broman
([report](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-173.pdf)).

Two solvers are available to solve the implicit DAE's generated. The
default is DASKR, a derivative of DASSL with root finding. A solver
based on the [Sundials](https://github.com/tshort/Sundials.jl) package
is also available.
    
Installation
------------

Sims is an installable package. To install Sims, use the following:

```julia
Pkg.add("Sims")
```

Sims.jl has one main module named `Sims` and the following submodules:

* `Sims.Lib` -- the standard library

* `Sims.Examples` -- example models, including:
  * `Sims.Examples.Basics`
  * `Sims.Examples.Lib`
  * `Sims.Examples.Neural`

Basic example
-------------

Sims defines a basic symbolic class used for unknown variables in
the model. As unknown variables are evaluated, expressions (of
type `MExpr`) are built up.

``` julia
julia> using Sims

julia> a = Unknown()
##1243

julia> a * (a + 1)
MExpr(*(##1243,+(##1243,1)))
```

In a simulation, the unknowns are to be solved based on a set of
equations. Equations are built from device models. 

A device model is a function that returns a vector of equations or
other devices that also return lists of equations. The equations
each are assumed equal to zero. So,

``` julia
der(y) = x + 1
```

Should be entered as:

``` julia
der(y) - (x+1)
```

`der` indicates a derivative.

The Van Der Pol oscillator is a simple problem with two equations
and two unknowns:

``` julia
function Vanderpol()
    y = Unknown(1.0, "y")   # The 1.0 is the initial value. "y" is for plotting.
    x = Unknown("x")        # The initial value is zero if not given.
    # The following gives the return value which is a list of equations.
    # Expressions with Unknowns are kept as expressions. Expressions of
    # regular variables are evaluated immediately.
    Equation[
        # The -1.0 in der(x, -1.0) is the initial value for the derivative 
        der(x, -1.0) - ((1 - y^2) * x - y)      # == 0 is assumed
        der(y) - x
    ]
end

y = sim(Vanderpol(), 10.0) # Run the simulation to 10 seconds and return
                           # the result as an array.
# plot the results with Gaston
gplot(y)
``` 

Here are the results:

![plot results](https://github.com/tshort/Sims.jl/blob/master/examples/basics/vanderpol.png?raw=true "Van Der Pol results")

An `@equations` macro is provided to return `Equation[]` allowing for
the use of equals in equations, so the example above can be:

``` julia
function Vanderpol()
    y = Unknown(1.0, "y") 
    x = Unknown("x")
    @equations begin
        der(x, -1.0) = (1 - y^2) * x - y
        der(y) = x
    end
end

y = sim(Vanderpol(), 10.0) # Run the simulation to 10 seconds and return
                           # the result as an array.
# plot the results
plot(y)
``` 

Electrical example
------------------

This example shows definitions of several electrical components. Each
is again a function that returns a list of equations. Equations are
expressions (type MExpr) that includes other expressions and unknowns
(type Unknown).

Arguments to each function are model parameters. These normally include
nodes specifying connectivity followed by parameters specifying model
characteristics.

Models can contain models or other functions that return equations.
The function `Branch` is a special function that returns an equation
specifying relationships between nodes and flows. It also acts as an
indicator to mark nodes. In the flattening/elaboration process,
equations are created to sum flows (in this case electrical currents)
to zero at all nodes. `RefBranch` is another special function for
marking nodes and flow variables.

Nodes passed as parameters or created with `ElectricalNode()` are simply
unknowns. For these electrical examples, a node is simply an unknown
voltage.
 
    
```julia
function Resistor(n1, n2, R::Real) 
    i = Current()   # This is simply an Unknown. 
    v = Voltage()
    @equations begin
        Branch(n1, n2, v, i)
        R * i = v
    end
end

function Capacitor(n1, n2, C::Real) 
    i = Current()
    v = Voltage()
    @equations begin
        Branch(n1, n2, v, i)
        C * der(v) = i
    end
end
```

What follows is a top-level circuit definition. In this case,
there are no input parameters. The ground reference "g" is
assigned zero volts.

All of the equations returned in the list of equations are other
models with various parameters.
   
```julia
function Circuit()
    n1 = Voltage("Source voltage")   # The string indicates labeling for plots
    n2 = Voltage("Output voltage")
    n3 = Voltage()
    g = 0.0  # A ground has zero volts; it's not an unknown.
    Equation[
        SineVoltage(n1, g, 10.0, 60.0)
        Resistor(n1, n2, 10.0)
        Resistor(n2, g, 5.0)
        SeriesProbe(n2, n3, "Capacitor current")
        Capacitor(n3, g, 5.0e-3)
    ]
end

ckt = Circuit()
ckt_y = sim(ckt, 0.1)
gplot(ckt_y)
```
Here are the results:

Initialization and Solving Sets of Equations
--------------------------------------------

Sims initialization is still weak, but it is developed enough to be
able to solve non-differential equations. Here is a small example
where two Unknowns, `x` and `y`, are solved based on the following two
equations:

```julia
function test()
    @unknown x y
    @equations begin
        2*x - y   = exp(-x)
         -x + 2*y = exp(-y)
    end
end

solution = solve(create_sim(test()))
```

Hybrid Modeling and Structural Variability
------------------------------------------

Sims supports basic hybrid modeling, including the ability to handle
structural model changes. Consider the following example:

[Breaking pendulum](https://github.com/tshort/Sims.jl/blob/master/examples/basics/breaking_pendulum_in_box.jl)

This model starts as a pendulum, then the wire breaks, and the ball
goes into free fall. Sims handles this much like
[Hydra](https://github.com/giorgidze/Hydra); the model is recompiled.
Because Julia can compile code just-in-time (JIT), this happens
relatively quickly. After the pendulum breaks, the ball bounces around
in a box. This shows off another feature of Sims: handling
nonstructural events. Each time the wall is hit, the velocity is
adjusted for the "bounce".

Here is an animation of the results. Note that the actual animation
was done in R, not Julia.
